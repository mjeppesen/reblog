They would never have seen anything like it before. They would not believe that it could work. They might suspect that you were mad or had some secret plan to steal power. They would fear revenge from the local lord, which is a sensible fear since it probably <em>would</em> happen.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a kind of justice in that world. Everyone in the world has a sense of right and wrong &#x2014; just as that they do here, but they have their place and they have their interests and loyalties and desires, and &#x2026; well, it&apos;s a big and interesting world.</p><p>Similarly to this, I remember once hearing John Hodgman say that it was interesting to him that <em>Game of Thrones</em> was so popular, given that it is not set in a world that anyone would want to live in. (Unlike say, that of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>).</p><p>Anyway, the article from Zepney Tufeki (<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/">here is the link again</a>) really had me thinking about it for a long time after I read it. I recommend it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
